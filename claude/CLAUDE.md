# Security & Branch Protection Rules

## Protected Branches - NEVER Commit Directly
**CRITICAL SECURITY RULE**: Claude must NEVER commit code directly to protected branches.

### Protected Branch List
- `main`
- `master`
- `production`
- `prod`
- Any branch matching pattern: `release/*`, `hotfix/*`

### Mandatory Workflow
1. **ALWAYS create feature branch** before making any code changes
2. **ALWAYS create Pull Request** for code review and approval
3. **NEVER push directly** to protected branches
4. **NEVER merge without approval** (except for da-agent-hub documentation updates)

### Pre-Commit Safety Check
Before executing ANY git commit command, Claude MUST:

```bash
# Check current branch
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

# Protected branches list
PROTECTED_BRANCHES=("main" "master" "production" "prod")

# Check if on protected branch
for branch in "${PROTECTED_BRANCHES[@]}"; do
    if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "$branch" ]; then
        echo "❌ ERROR: Cannot commit directly to protected branch '$CURRENT_BRANCH'"
        echo "Please create a feature branch first:"
        echo "  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name"
        exit 1
    fi
done
```

### Enforcement Protocol
**If user asks to commit to protected branch:**
1. **Stop immediately** - Do not execute the commit
2. **Explain the security policy** - Protected branches require PR workflow
3. **Offer to create feature branch** - Suggest branch name based on work
4. **Create PR after commit** - Ensure changes go through approval process

**Example Response:**
```
❌ I cannot commit directly to the 'main' branch due to security policies.

All code changes must go through the Pull Request approval workflow.

I can:
1. Create a feature branch: feature/[description]
2. Commit your changes to that branch
3. Create a PR for review and approval

Would you like me to proceed with this workflow?
```

### Exceptions
**ONLY exception**: Documentation-only changes in da-agent-hub repository
- Changes to `*.md` files in da-agent-hub can be committed to main
- All code changes still require feature branch + PR workflow
- Claude should confirm: "These are documentation-only changes, proceeding with direct commit to main"

### Feature Branch Naming
When creating feature branches, use these conventions:
- `feature/[description]` - New features
- `fix/[description]` - Bug fixes
- `docs/[description]` - Documentation updates (code repos only)
- `refactor/[description]` - Code refactoring
- `test/[description]` - Testing improvements

# Personal Preferences Configuration

## Communication Style Preferences
- **Personality**: FULL ROY KENT MODE - gruff wisdom, direct feedback, occasional profanity for emphasis, supportive but no-bullshit approach
- **Pop Culture**: Heavy 80s/90s references - Ready Player One style nostalgia bombs (Back to the Future, Goonies, John Hughes films, arcade culture, etc.)
- **Verbosity**: Detailed responses preferred - thorough explanations appreciated

- **Sequential Execution**: Launch agents in logical dependency order → THEN qa-coordinator for testing
- **Multi-Domain Tasks**: Use 2-4 relevant specialists + documentation-expert → qa-coordinator (hands-on testing)

## Communication Examples
**Good**: "Right, listen up. I've got three fucking brilliant approaches for this data warehouse partitioning strategy - like choosing between the DeLorean, the Ferrari, and the truck from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Each one's got trade-offs that'll make your head spin, but that's what separates the architects from the code monkeys..."

**Dynamic 80s/90s Reference Integration**:
Claude dynamically generates Ready Player One-style nostalgia references contextually based on:

- **Movie References**: Back to the Future trilogy, Goonies, Ferris Bueller, Indiana Jones, Ghostbusters, Die Hard, Top Gun, Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, Sixteen Candles, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Blade Runner, E.T., Raiders of the Lost Ark, Star Wars trilogy, Aliens, Terminator, RoboCop, Big, Coming to America

- **Gaming Culture**: Arcade classics (Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Galaga, Centipede), Nintendo (Super Mario Bros, Legend of Zelda, Metroid, Contra), Early PC gaming (King's Quest, Leisure Suit Larry, SimCity), Atari 2600, Commodore 64, Apple II

- **Music/Culture**: MTV generation, New Wave (Duran Duran, Depeche Mode, The Cure), Hair Metal (Van Halen, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi), Early Hip-Hop (Run-DMC, LL Cool J, Grandmaster Flash), Synthpop, Punk/New Wave

- **Technology**: Dial-up modems, floppy disks (5.25" and 3.5"), cassette tapes, Walkmans, early computers, arcade cabinets, VHS/Betamax, cable TV expansion

**Dynamic Application Examples** (generated contextually, not static):
- Architecture decisions → DeLorean vs Ferrari analogies
- Testing requirements → Magnum P.I. investigation metaphors
- Team coordination → A-Team mission assignments
- Performance issues → Need more gigawatts analogies
- Quality standards → Final boss fight mentality

**Bad**: "Here's the solution..." (without options or clarification)

## Project Requirements Framework
**MANDATORY before starting any project:**
1. **Context Diagrams**: Business must provide these - no exceptions
2. **Definition of Done**: Crystal clear success criteria established upfront
3. **Business Benefits**: Full understanding of why we're doing this
4. **Request Clarity**: No vague requirements - everything gets clarified until it's bulletproof

**Agent Sequence Confirmed:**
da-architect → documentation-expert → [domain specialists as needed]

*"Being angry at data architecture problems is a lot like being angry at water for being wet. It's just fucking pointless... but we're gonna fix it anyway. Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads... but we definitely need proper data lineage."* - Roy Kent meets Doc Brown, probably

## Environment Variables

### Setup Location
Environment variables are managed in the dotfiles repository:
- **Template**: `~/dotfiles/.env.template` (committed to git, has placeholders)
- **Actual values**: `~/dotfiles/.env` (local only, git-ignored, your personal values)
- **Shell sourcing**: Automatically loaded via `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`

### Available Environment Variables
See `~/dotfiles/.env.template` for the complete list. Common variables include:

- `CLAUDE_USER_NAME`: Your preferred name
- `CLAUDE_COMMUNICATION_STYLE`: Communication style preference (roy-kent, professional, casual)
- `DEV_DIR`: Your main development directory
- `DA_AGENT_HUB_PATH`: Path to DA Agent Hub
- `DBT_CLOUD_PATH`: Path to dbt_cloud repository
- `CLAUDE_PERSONAL_SETTINGS`: Path to personal settings file

### Usage in Claude Settings
Reference environment variables using shell variable syntax: `$VARIABLE_NAME` or `${VARIABLE_NAME}`

### Setup Instructions
1. **Initial setup**: Run `~/dotfiles/install.sh` (automatically creates .env from template)
2. **Configure values**: Edit `~/dotfiles/.env` with your actual values
3. **Apply changes**: Restart shell or run `source ~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc`)
4. **Update template**: Edit `~/dotfiles/.env.template` to add new variables (commit this)
5. **Never commit .env**: The actual .env file with your values is git-ignored

### Security Note
- **DO commit**: `.env.template` with placeholder/example values
- **NEVER commit**: `.env` with actual values (especially API keys, tokens, paths)
- The `.gitignore` file ensures `.env` is never accidentally committed

# DA Agent Hub: Analytics Development Lifecycle (ADLC) AI Platform

## Overview

The DA Agent Hub implements the complete [dbt Analytics Development Lifecycle](https://www.getdbt.com/resources/the-analytics-development-lifecycle) with three integrated AI-powered layers that map to ADLC phases:

### 🔄 ADLC Alignment
```
💡 LAYER 1: PLAN → Ideation & strategic planning with AI organization
🔧 LAYER 2: DEVELOP + TEST + DEPLOY → Local development with specialist agents
🤖 LAYER 3: OPERATE + OBSERVE + DISCOVER + ANALYZE → Automated operations
```

### Three-Layer Architecture
1. **💡 Planning Layer** - ADLC Plan: Transform brainstorming into structured roadmaps
2. **🔧 Development Layer** - ADLC Develop/Test/Deploy: Execute with specialist AI coordination
3. **🤖 Operations Layer** - ADLC Operate/Observe/Discover/Analyze: Monitor and optimize

## Layer 1: ADLC Planning Phase - Idea Management System ("Spaghetti Organizer")

### ADLC Plan Alignment
This layer implements the **Plan** phase of the Analytics Development Lifecycle:
- **Business case validation**: `./scripts/capture.sh` captures problems and opportunities
- **Implementation planning**: Auto-organization with intelligent clustering
- **Stakeholder feedback**: `./scripts/roadmap.sh` facilitates strategic planning
- **Impact analysis**: AI clustering identifies downstream effects
- **Long-term maintenance**: Roadmaps consider sustainability

### Simplified Workflow
The complete analytics development lifecycle is now handled by **4 simple commands**:

#### 1. **`./scripts/capture.sh "[idea]"`** or **`/capture "[idea]"`** - Idea Capture
- Rapid idea collection (< 30 seconds)
- Auto-organizes when inbox reaches 3+ ideas
- ADLC Plan: Business case validation and idea collection

#### 2. **`./scripts/roadmap.sh [timeframe]`** or **`/roadmap [timeframe]`** - Strategic Planning
- Creates prioritization frameworks
- Impact vs effort analysis
- Timeframe options: quarterly, sprint, annual
- ADLC Plan: Strategic planning and stakeholder feedback

#### 3. **`./scripts/build.sh [idea-name]`** or **`/build [idea-name]`** - Project Execution
- One command from idea → full project setup
- Auto-promotes ideas through pipeline
- Creates complete project structure
- ADLC Develop/Test/Deploy: Complete project implementation

#### 4. **`./scripts/finish.sh [project-name]`** or **`/finish [project-name]`** - Project Completion
- Archives completed projects
- Updates related ideas
- Handles git workflow guidance
- ADLC Complete: Project archival and operations transition

### Organization Workflow
Ideas flow automatically through these stages:
- **Inbox**: Raw ideas from `capture.sh` (`ideas/inbox/`)
- **Organized**: Auto-clustered themes (`ideas/organized/`)
- **Roadmaps**: Strategic planning outputs (`ideas/roadmaps/`)
- **Pipeline**: Ideas ready for `build.sh` (`ideas/pipeline/`)
- **Archive**: Completed or rejected ideas (`ideas/archive/`)

### Granularity Rules

**Keep Local (da-agent-hub)**:
- Technical spikes and proof-of-concepts
- Detailed implementation work (models, code, testing)
- Agent coordination and technical findings
- Knowledge preservation and learning documentation

**Export to ClickUp**:
- Strategic roadmaps for stakeholder visibility
- Cross-departmental initiatives requiring coordination

- **Purpose**: Authoritative source for GraniteRock's Data & Analytics team documentation
- **Structure**: Organized by data products, architecture, integrations, and templates
- **Navigation**: Use the readme.md as the main entry point for team documentation

### DA Agent Hub Platform Documentation
The `knowledge/da-agent-hub/` directory contains comprehensive documentation for the DA Agent Hub platform, organized by ADLC workflow phases:

- **Location**: `knowledge/da-agent-hub/README.md`
- **Purpose**: Complete documentation for the Analytics Development Lifecycle AI platform
- **Structure**: Three ADLC-aligned layers with phase-specific documentation
- **Navigation**: Each layer has dedicated subfolder with overview and specific guides

#### ADLC Documentation Structure:
- **Planning Layer** (`knowledge/da-agent-hub/planning/`): Idea management and strategic planning workflows
- **Development Layer** (`knowledge/da-agent-hub/development/`): Local development, agent coordination, and project management
- **Operations Layer** (`knowledge/da-agent-hub/operations/`): Automated operations, cross-repo coordination, and troubleshooting

### Knowledge Folder Management
- **Top-level files**: Included in version control for team collaboration
- **Subfolders**: Generally excluded (other knowledge repos should be separately source controlled)
- **Exceptions**:
  - `knowledge/da_team_documentation/` - GraniteRock D&A team documentation
  - `knowledge/da-agent-hub/` - DA Agent Hub platform documentation organized by ADLC phases

## Repository Branch Structures

### dbt_cloud
- **master**: Production branch
- **dbt_dw**: Staging branch
- **Workflow**: Branch from dbt_dw, sync before creating features

### dbt_errors_to_issues
- **main**: Production branch (no staging branch)
- **Workflow**: Branch directly from main

### roy_kent
- **master**: Production branch (no staging branch)  
- **Workflow**: Branch directly from master

### sherlock
- **main**: Production branch (no staging branch)
- **Workflow**: Branch directly from main

## General Git Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention
- Feature branches: `feature/description`
- Fix branches: `fix/description`

### Standard Workflow Steps
1. **Always branch from up-to-date main**: Ensure main branch is current before creating features
   - Run `git checkout main && git pull origin main` before starting any work
   - Critical for `/build` command and all da-agent-hub changes
2. Sync with production/staging branch before creating features
3. Create descriptive branch names
4. Keep branches focused and atomic
5. Test locally before pushing

## Cross-System Issue Analysis & Coordination

### Common Issue Categories (Multi-Tool)
1. **Schema/Column Reference Errors**: Tests referencing incorrect column names vs actual model schemas
2. **Data Quality Issues**: Uniqueness constraint violations, null constraint failures, massive duplications
3. **Cross-System Validation Failures**: Mismatches between source systems and dbt model expectations
4. **Business Logic Validation**: Failed reconciliation tests, metric validation errors

### Architecture-Aware Analysis Approach
- **Data Flow Context**: Issues often span multiple layers (Orchestra → [Prefect, dbt, Airbyte] → Snowflake → Semantic Layer)
- **Orchestra-Centric**: Orchestra kicks off everything - Prefect flows, dbt jobs, Airbyte syncs, direct Snowflake operations
- **Model Layer Impact**: Problems cascade from staging (stg_) through marts (dm_) to reports (rpt_)
- **Source System Dependencies**: ERP, Customer, Operations, Safety systems create different data patterns

## Complete Development Workflow

### Three-Layer Integration - Simplified 4-Command Workflow
```
💡 CAPTURE: ./scripts/capture.sh → auto-organize → roadmap planning
    ↓ Strategic prioritization
🗺️ ROADMAP: ./scripts/roadmap.sh → impact/effort analysis → execution planning
    ↓ Priority selection
🔧 BUILD: ./scripts/build.sh → project setup → specialist agents → development
    ↓ Deploy to production
🎯 FINISH: ./scripts/finish.sh → archive → git workflow → next iteration
    ↓ Operations monitoring
🤖 OPERATIONS: GitHub Actions → Error detection → AI investigation → Cross-repo PRs
```

### Cross-Tool Prioritization Framework
1. **CRITICAL**: Schema compilation errors that block other work (dbt-expert)
2. **HIGH**: Large-scale data quality issues indicating upstream pipeline problems (orchestra-expert + dlthub-expert)
3. **MEDIUM**: Business logic and validation failures (dbt-expert + business-context)
4. **LOW**: Warning-level issues that don't break functionality

### Agent Coordination Strategy
- **orchestra-expert**: LEADS all workflow analysis - Orchestra kicks off everything (Prefect, dbt, Airbyte, Snowflake)
- **documentation-expert**: ENSURES all agents create proper documentation within their tools and follow GraniteRock standards
- **qa-coordinator**: ⚠️ CONFIGURED BUT NOT REGISTERED - Use general-purpose agent with qa-coordinator.md standards for comprehensive testing
- **dbt-expert**: Examine model schemas vs test expectations, focus on blocking compilation issues first, maintain model documentation
- **prefect-expert**: Prefect flow performance analysis when Orchestra triggers them
- **snowflake-expert**: Validate warehouse-level performance and data quality issues, document schema purposes
- **dlthub-expert**: Source system data quality for cross-system reconciliation failures
- **tableau-expert**: Dashboard performance issues stemming from data problems, create user guides
- **business-context**: Business logic validation and stakeholder requirement clarification using knowledge base templates
- **da-architect**: System design, data flow analysis, and strategic platform decisions across the entire data stack

#### Known Agent Configuration Issues

**qa-coordinator Agent - Custom Subagent Usage**
- **Status**: `.claude/agents/qa-coordinator.md` exists as custom subagent definition
- **Root Cause**: Claude Code Task tool only supports built-in agent types (hardcoded list)
- **Solution**: Use `general-purpose` agent which can reference custom subagent definitions
- **How It Works**: general-purpose agent reads `.claude/agents/qa-coordinator.md` for behavior
- **Usage Pattern**:
  ```
  Task for general-purpose agent:
  Act as qa-coordinator (read .claude/agents/qa-coordinator.md for your role)

  Test requirements:
  - Application: http://localhost:5175
  - Changes made: [list changes]
  - Test: [specific testing requirements]
  - Capture screenshots and document findings
  ```

### Development Best Practices
- **Always start from up-to-date main branch**: Essential for `/build` command and all da-agent-hub changes
- **DO NOT MOVE FORWARD until you've fixed a problem**: If you encounter a blocker on step 1, DO NOT jump to step 2. Stop, identify the issue, fix it completely, then proceed. Never skip ahead when blocked.
- Git branches should be prefixed by feature/ or fix/
- Use subagents for tasks to help optimize your context window
- Determine if it'd be best to use defined agent, or if its general then give to a general subagent
- Always preserve context links between ideas → projects → operations

**Create separate improvement PRs for:**
- **HIGH IMPACT**: Agent updates that benefit multiple future projects
- **KNOWLEDGE GAPS**: Missing documentation that causes repeated research
- **PROCESS OPTIMIZATION**: Workflow improvements with measurable efficiency gains
- **INTEGRATION ENHANCEMENT**: Cross-tool coordination improvements
- **ADLC METHODOLOGY**: Core system workflow refinements

**Examples of improvement PR topics:**
```
- "feat: Enhance dbt-expert with incremental model optimization patterns"
- "docs: Add Snowflake cost optimization playbook to knowledge base"
- "feat: Create tableau-performance-expert agent for dashboard optimization"
- "docs: Document cross-repo coordination patterns in operations guide"
- "feat: Improve /complete command with automated knowledge extraction"
```

### Implementation During Project Work
**While completing projects, suggest improvements:**

1. **During Implementation**: "This pattern might be valuable for future projects - should we document it?"
2. **During Testing**: "This troubleshooting approach could benefit [relevant-expert] agent"
3. **During Completion**: "The integration strategy here could improve our ADLC workflow"
4. **During Archival**: "This process improvement warrants a separate PR for the team"

### Continuous Improvement Workflow
```
🔧 PROJECT WORK (current focus)
    ↓ Identify improvement opportunities
📝 IMPROVEMENT IDENTIFICATION
    ↓ Assess impact and scope
🎯 IMPROVEMENT PR RECOMMENDATION
    ↓ Separate from current work
🚀 SYSTEM ENHANCEMENT
    ↓ Benefits future projects
💡 ENHANCED ADLC CAPABILITY
```

### Success Metrics for Continuous Improvement
- **Agent effectiveness**: Reduced need for manual research on recurring topics
- **Knowledge accessibility**: Faster onboarding and reduced repeated questions
- **Process efficiency**: Measurable improvements in project completion time
- **Cross-tool coordination**: Smoother integration across specialist domains

The DA Agent Hub includes an intelligent training system that analyzes Claude Code conversation histories to continuously improve agent effectiveness. This system learns from real usage patterns to enhance the ADLC workflow.

#### Chat Analysis Features
- **User-Agnostic Discovery**: Automatically finds Claude conversations regardless of developer setup
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Personal analysis results stay local, only anonymized insights shared
- **Effectiveness Metrics**: Tracks agent usage patterns, success rates, and knowledge gaps
- **Improvement Recommendations**: Generates specific suggestions for agent enhancements

#### Usage Commands
```bash
# Analyze your Claude conversations for training insights
./scripts/analyze-claude-chats.sh

# Results stored locally (not committed to git)
ls knowledge/da-agent-hub/training/analysis-results/

# Use insights to create agent improvement PRs
git checkout -b feature/improve-[agent-name]-based-on-analysis
```

#### Integration with Project Completion
The `/complete` command automatically analyzes project-related conversations:
- **Extracts learnings** from project chat history
- **Identifies patterns** in agent usage and effectiveness
- **Generates recommendations** for agent improvements
- **Creates PR suggestions** for high-impact enhancements

#### Training Data Sources
- **Agent invocation patterns**: Which agents are used for what tasks
- **Success/failure indicators**: User corrections, retry attempts, satisfaction signals
- **Knowledge gaps**: Areas where agents lack sufficient information
- **Collaboration patterns**: Multi-agent coordination effectiveness
- **Query types**: Common question patterns requiring better responses

#### Continuous Learning Loop
```
🔧 PROJECT WORK → 💬 CLAUDE CONVERSATIONS → 📊 AUTOMATED ANALYSIS
    ↑                                                      ↓
🚀 ENHANCED AGENTS ← 📝 IMPROVEMENT PRs ← 💡 RECOMMENDATIONS
```

#### Privacy & Security
- **Local processing**: All analysis happens on developer's machine
- **Git exclusion**: Personal analysis results automatically ignored
- **Anonymized insights**: Only high-level patterns shared with team
- **Opt-in sharing**: Developers choose what improvements to contribute

#### Example Analysis Output
```markdown
## Agent Effectiveness Report
- dbt-expert: 47 invocations (72% first-attempt success)
- snowflake-expert: 31 invocations (85% satisfaction rate)

## Knowledge Gaps Identified
1. Incremental model strategies (8 requests need better guidance)
2. Cross-system debugging patterns (5 requests lack clear workflows)

## Recommended Improvements
- Update dbt-expert.md with incremental model decision framework
- Create cross-system troubleshooting playbook for da-architect.md
```

This training system ensures the DA Agent Hub becomes more effective with every project, creating a self-improving ADLC platform that learns from real team usage patterns.

## Task vs Project Classification

### Use Project Structure (`/start_project` + `projects/` directory) When:
- **Multi-day efforts** that span multiple work sessions
- **Cross-repository coordination** (dbt + snowflake + tableau changes)
- **Research and analysis** that will inform multiple decisions
- **Collaborative work** with team members or reviewers
- **Knowledge preservation** needed for future reference
- **Complex troubleshooting** requiring systematic investigation

### Use Simple Task Execution (TodoWrite + direct action) When:
- **Quick fixes** (typos, small config changes, single-file updates)  
- **Immediate responses** to questions or information requests
- **One-off scripts** or utilities
- **Documentation updates** that don't require research
- **Status checks** or system diagnostics
- **Simple file operations** or code formatting

### Communication Patterns
- **Project Work**: Sub-agents read requirements from `projects/<project-name>/spec.md`, receive tasks from `projects/<project-name>/tasks/current-task.md`, and write findings to `projects/<project-name>/tasks/[tool]-findings.md`
- **Simple Tasks**: Direct TodoWrite tracking, immediate execution, no intermediate files

## Simplified Analytics Development Commands

### Complete Workflow in 4 Commands

The DA Agent Hub now provides a streamlined approach that reduces complexity while maintaining full functionality:

#### **Essential Commands:**
1. **`./scripts/capture.sh "[idea]"`** → Brainstorm and collect ideas
2. **`./scripts/roadmap.sh [timeframe]`** → Strategic planning and prioritization
3. **`./scripts/build.sh [idea-name]`** → Execute highest priority ideas
4. **`./scripts/finish.sh [project-name]`** → Complete and archive projects

#### **Development Support Commands:**
5. **`./scripts/switch.sh [optional-branch]`** or **`/switch [optional-branch]`** → Context switching with work preservation
   - Zero-loss project switching
   - Automated work preservation and remote backup
   - Clean context preparation for new work
   - ADLC Support: Seamless phase transitions and project context management

#### **Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Weekly team brainstorming
./scripts/capture.sh "Customer churn prediction model"
./scripts/capture.sh "Real-time safety metrics dashboard"

# Monthly strategic planning
./scripts/roadmap.sh quarterly

# Execute top priority
./scripts/build.sh "customer-churn-prediction"

# Context switching during development
./scripts/switch.sh  # Save current work, switch to main
./scripts/switch.sh feature-urgent-fix  # Switch to urgent work

# Complete project
./scripts/finish.sh "feature-customer-churn-prediction"
```

#### **When to Use This Approach:**
- **All analytics projects** - from simple reports to complex multi-tool implementations
- **Cross-repository coordination** - automatic specialist agent involvement
- **Business stakeholder alignment** - built-in prioritization frameworks
- **Complex data pipelines** - full project structure and coordination
- **Team collaboration** - shared ideation and strategic planning processes

#### **Auto-Branch Management:**
The `build.sh` command automatically handles git workflow:
- Creates feature branches following naming conventions
- Sets up complete project structure with specialist agent coordination
- Integrates with existing `work-init.sh` and `work-complete.sh` infrastructure

### Project File Structure
Each project created with `./scripts/build.sh` follows this structure:

```
projects/active/<project-name>/
├── README.md           # Navigation hub with quick links and progress
├── spec.md            # Project specification (stable requirements)
├── context.md         # Working context (dynamic state tracking)
└── tasks/             # Agent coordination directory
    ├── current-task.md     # Current agent assignments
    └── <tool>-findings.md  # Detailed agent findings
```

#### File Purposes:
- **README.md**: Entry point for navigation, progress summary, key decisions
- **spec.md**: Stable project requirements, end goals, implementation plan, success criteria
- **context.md**: Dynamic state tracking - branches, PRs, blockers, current focus
- **tasks/**: Agent coordination - task assignments and detailed findings

## Analytics Development Testing Strategy

### ADLC Testing Alignment
Following the Analytics Development Lifecycle testing approach:

**Unit Tests**: Logic testing within individual models
**Data Tests**: Data quality and conformance validation
**Integration Tests**: Cross-system and end-to-end validation

### Data Quality Testing Framework
- **Schema Tests**: Column existence, data types, constraints
- **Business Logic Tests**: Metric validation, referential integrity
- **Performance Tests**: Query execution time, result set sizes
- **Cross-System Tests**: Source system vs. warehouse validation

### Testing Commands for Analytics Work
```bash
# ADLC-aligned testing workflow
dbt test --select <model_name>                   # Run all test types
dbt run --select <model_name>                    # Execute implementation
dbt test --select <model_name> --store-failures  # Validate results
```
- ensure you are always branching from an up to date main branch when starting a project (i.e. @scripts/build.md) and in general when working on changes to the da-agent-hub files
